                    <p>On top of keeping your balances in one place BMB lets you graph your earnings over time and compare between sites to see which are most profitable. There's also a quick update button to get the latest balance without having to open the page yourself.

                    <p>BMB also allows you to do automatic updates. You set the time period and BMB will automatically visit the page and check your balance. You can couple this with the notification ability to get updates any time your passive apps stop earning money.
